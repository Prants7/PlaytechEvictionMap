EvictionMap project made with Gradle
written by TÃµnis Prants

main functionality is under src/main/java/implementation
extra modules that clean up after expired data are under src/main/java/dataCleaner

main tests are under src/test/java/implementation
extra tests for interior components are under src/test/java/extraTests

How to use:

The api class for interacting with EvictionMap is EvictionMapImplementation<Key,Value>
(EvictionMap<Key,Value> itself is an interface for it)
This class can be made into an object with 2 different constructors.
First of them has only one input and that is the amount of seconds after witch the data becomes inaccessible.
The second constructor also accepts an element of DataCleaner<Key> type. The project has an InstantExpiringValueCleaner
class of cleaner that will make sure that all expired values will be removed from memory in about second or two.

In order to get more control over data cleaning its possible to write extra modules that implement the DataCleanerBase
class and can call either
    callForCleanUpOnKey(Key keyToCallOn) for checks on specific key entries
    callForFullCleanUp() for checking the entire memory for expired entries
In both cases only already expired key-value pairs will be deleted.
